                        There is so little about what the spirit of prophecy is. It is almost a topic which is hardly mentioned. How about if that topic would be the core itself of what the book of Mormon is about? Would you give it a try and try to find out more and learn about this profound and life-changing topic? In this website, I intend to talk about that. I plan to explain and prove the relationship between the spirit of prophecy, the real testimony of Jesus, and a Hope in Christ. For this purpose I will use as many scriptures as possible. I will include the words of prophets such as Joseph Smith’s words in order to make it clear about that. I will try my best to persuade you to believe in these things that you might want to change and look for the things which were hidden from you because or ignorance or fixed ideas. What is the Spirit of Prophecy? What is the Testimony of Jesus? What is a Hope in Christ? What’s the relationship of those concepts between each other?
