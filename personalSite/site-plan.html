        There is so little about what the spirit of prophecy is. It is almost a topic which is hardly mentioned. How about if that topic would be the core itself of what the book of Mormon is about? Would you give it a try and try to find out more and learn about this profound and life-changing topic? In this website, I intend to talk about that. I plan to explain and prove the relationship between the spirit of prophecy, the real testimony of Jesus, and a Hope in Christ. For this purpose I will use as many scriptures as possible. I will include the words of prophets such as Joseph Smith’s words in order to make it clear about that. I will try my best to persuade you to believe in these things that you might want to change and look for the things which were hidden from you because or ignorance or fixed ideas. What is the Spirit of Prophecy? What is the Testimony of Jesus? What is a Hope in Christ? What’s the relationship of those concepts between each other?
According to the scripture found on Revelations 19:10 “…for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy” which means the Spirit of Prophecy is the Testimony of Jesus, but what is the Testimony of Jesus?  According to Elder Bruce R. McConkie, a testimony comes from the spirit of God. He said that his testimony of Jesus came from personal revelation from the Holy Spirit to his soul that Jesus is the Lord. Let us read from the Book of Mormon what personal revelation is: “For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore, they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.” (Alma 36:26) Let us pay attention to the words: “I have seen eye to eye.” Now let’s read this: “And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul delighteth in his words. For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him. And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.” (2 Nephi 11:2-3) It’s interesting that Nephi explains how Isaiah, he and Jacob have a testimony of Jesus saying: “…he veriIy saw… I have seen him… he has also seen him,” and then Nephi also mention the need of witnesses. The definition of a witness is basically a person that sees something, someone who has knowledge from personal observation or experience. A real testimony of Jesus is the experience of seeing him. When we have the experience of seeing Jesus, then we can say that we have the true, real testimony of Jesus. Let’s read one more scripture: “And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood. And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things;”

      <h3>BEING BORN AGAIN</h3>
      <p>
        When a person receives the Real Testimony of Jesus, that person is being born again. Being Jesus the father, being him the one who gives a new life. One in which there is no desire to do evil but to be an instrument of God.

      <h3>Hope in Christ/Heavenly Gift</h3>
      <p>
        When a person receives the Second Counselor from time to time that person will receive the ministry of Jesus himself who will teach him and make his or her calling and election sure.
