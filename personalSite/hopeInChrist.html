                    It’s interesting that Nephi explains how Isaiah, he and Jacob have a testimony of Jesus saying: “…he veriIy saw… I have seen him… he has also seen him,” and then Nephi also mention the need of witnesses. The definition of a witness is basically a person that sees something, someone who has knowledge from personal observation or experience.

                    A real testimony of Jesus is the experience of seeing him. When we have the experience of seeing Jesus, then we can say that we have the true, real testimony of Jesus. Let’s read one more scripture: “And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood. And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things;”
