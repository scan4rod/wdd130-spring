                    According to the scripture found on Revelations 19:10 “…for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy” which means the Spirit of Prophecy is the Testimony of Jesus, but what is the Testimony of Jesus? According to Elder Bruce R. McConkie, a testimony comes from the spirit of God. He said that his testimony of Jesus came from personal revelation from the Holy Spirit to his soul that Jesus is the Lord. Let us read from the Book of Mormon what personal revelation is: “For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore, they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.” (Alma 36:26)

                    Let us pay attention to the words: “I have seen eye to eye.” Now let’s read this: “And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul delighteth in his words. For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him. And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.” (2 Nephi 11:2-3)
